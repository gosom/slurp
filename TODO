finish networking code
switch from awful generated flex scanner classes to reentrant C routines, (use external linkage?)
fix the flex ruleset, it is badly broken
use QT for socket io, threadpool, hash table, url validation
use libevent instead of calling epoll directly ( for cross platform asynchronous event handling )
use libcurl(++) to formulate http get requests
