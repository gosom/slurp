Before attempting to compile make sure you have libevent, libcurl, and qt configured.
Not only do the libraries need to be installed, but their development headers.
Pkg-config needs to know about libevent and libcurl, and qt needs to be in a searchable path.

You will likely need to go to libevent.org and curl.haxx.se and compile/install those packages
if you haven't done that recently. Make sure to delete or otherwise make inaccessible any 
development libraries from these packages that may already exist on your system prior to compiling 
them, as they may cause all kinds of trouble at various stages of the process.

Once the dependencies are satisfied, you should be able to simply type:

qmake
make
make install

Linux is directly supported. 
This code *SHOULD* compile on any current versions of Windows, Mac OS, and probably a few others.
