Dependencies:
 libevent 2.0.16
 libcurl 7.23.1
 pkg-config 0.21
 qt 4.7.3
 flex 2.5.4

Once the dependencies are satisfied, you should be able to simply type:

$ qmake
$ make

Linux is directly supported. 

This code *SHOULD* compile on any current versions of Windows, Mac OS, 
and probably a few others, but it'll probably take some hacking.
