Dependencies:
 libevent
 libcurl 
 pkg-config 
 qt
 flex

Once the dependencies are satisfied, you should be able to simply type:

$ qmake
$ make

Linux is directly supported. 

This code *SHOULD* compile on any current versions of Windows, Mac OS, 
and probably a few others, but it'll probably take some hacking.
